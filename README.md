# PAM

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

PAM is Baywatch for developers and AI agents working inside corporate
environments: always on watch, confident, and ready with the verified project
story. It keeps durable context, turns noisy evidence into compact answers,
safely brokers approved tools, and runs repeatable flows without sending the
developer's workspace to a hosted control plane.

PAM is designed as a Rust authority boundary with a dedicated desktop shell:

```text
pam                         # client mode (default)
pam daemon                  # local background service
pam gui                     # launches the installed desktop control center
pam flow run "release check"
```

Desktop previews target Linux arm64/amd64, Windows arm64/amd64, and Apple
Silicon macOS. The embedded llama.cpp/Metal runtime remains macOS-only; the
portable desktop surfaces report that limitation instead of implying a model
is available.

## Why PAM

Coding agents are capable, but corporate development work is fragmented across
build logs, Git, CI, SonarQube, Jira, Confluence, credentials, policy prompts,
and restrictive sandboxes. Agents also lose useful context when conversations
are compacted or restarted. PAM sits locally between agents and those systems,
preserving verified continuity and returning small, evidence-backed results.

PAM should help an agent answer:

- What project am I acting on, and what work is already in flight?
- What actually failed, where is the evidence, and what can PAM safely fix?
- Which action requires human approval?
- What changed, how was it verified, and what remains unresolved?

## Product shape

- **Local first:** state, logs, policy, and model weights stay under the user's
  control by default.
- **Durable per-project queues:** callers share one project timeline without
  racing or repeating expensive work.
- **Safe capability bridge:** callers receive narrowly scoped access rather
  than inheriting every credential on the machine.
- **Compact evidence:** deterministic log reduction comes before optional local
  model summarization; original evidence is always addressable.
- **Flows:** developers compose auditable sequences in the GUI or as files and
  run them with `pam flow run "name"`.
- **Local inference:** PAM integrates with `llama.cpp`, helps acquire compatible
  models, and never ships model weights. The default model location is
  `~/llm/<vendor>/<model-name>.<extension>` unless the user chooses another.
- **Companion continuity:** PAM can cooperate with tools such as `ptrack`
  through supported interfaces instead of taking ownership of their storage.
- **Connectors ship dormant:** corporate connectors are built in but inert
  until the user enables each one, stores its credential in the native
  credential store, and runs a connection test from the GUI.
- **Skills are global-first:** the skill inventory is managed once per machine,
  with per-project assignment on demand.

## Connectors

All connector operations are read-only, policy-gated, and audited; the GUI
Connectors panel lists whatever the daemon registers, so new connectors appear
without frontend changes.

| Connector | Surface | Credential |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | workflow runs and logs | token |
| Jenkins | jobs, builds, console logs | `user:api-token` |
| SonarQube | quality gate, issues | token |
| Jira Data Center | projects, issues (JQL) | personal access token |
| Confluence Cloud | pages (CQL) | `email:api-token` |
| SharePoint (Microsoft Graph) | documents, lists | bearer token, sovereign-cloud base URL |
| AWS CLI passthrough | curated allowlist of read-only `aws` commands | none stored — the local CLI resolves the user's own `~/.aws` chain; an optional stored profile name is passed as `--profile` |

## Current status

The product foundation, walking skeleton, durable project-continuity, local
trust-and-policy, and desktop-control-center slices are implemented. The pinned
Rust workspace builds one `pam` binary with three modes — client (default,
covering status, brief, wait, result, evidence, caller, access, approval,
network-diagnostics, audit-export, and retention), `pam gui` for the embedded
Tauri control center, and `pam daemon` for the IPC daemon. The daemon durably schedules per-project work in SQLite,
recovers leases after restart, replays ordered events, retains exact
content-addressed evidence, and obtains project context from `ptrack` only
through its supported JSON CLI. The workspace also contains a tested,
deterministic log compactor and a bounded, directly embedded llama.cpp runtime
behind the existing authenticated PAM protocol; compactor integration remains
future work. LLMLingua-2 is recorded as a possible staged semantic compressor,
but is not integrated; it may load on demand and unload before the selected
model. The 20 GB ceiling applies to the active Qwen profile, not installed
tools. The model path is text-only, English-first, and intended for coding
plus Python/SQL data analysis. It does not expose an HTTP model endpoint.

Production requests authenticate a registered, revocable caller whose secret is
kept in the operating system's native credential store. Project policy is
default-deny with explicit-deny precedence and exact-effect, one-time approvals.
Native-trust network diagnostics expose only sanitized configuration facts;
audit export is project-scoped and redacted; evidence and audit retention are
explicit, bounded, and crash-recoverable. Model registration verifies exact
user-owned bytes and license consent; model loading is disabled unless the
daemon receives `--model VENDOR/NAME`, then fails closed on the 20 GB profile,
fresh memory pressure, swap trend, Metal working set, and OS/PAM reserves.
The connector platform is implemented with seven read-only connectors (see
[Connectors](#connectors)). Flow authoring, service-manager integration,
peer-credential transport hardening, and screen-reader semantics remain later
roadmap slices. PAC
evaluation and live managed enterprise CA/proxy behavior are not claimed; no
managed-environment interviews or workflow observations have been conducted.

Initialize the CLI caller and grant only the capabilities needed for the
current project:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- caller register
cargo run -p pam_cli -- access grant daemon.status --resource daemon
cargo run -p pam_cli -- access grant brief.read
```

Run the daemon from an initialized project in one terminal:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- daemon
```

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- status
cargo run -p pam_cli -- brief
```

The first supported embedded model profile is the user-owned
Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct Q4_K_S artifact documented in
`docs/model-memory.md`. Register its exact bytes and accepted license snapshot;
if policy denies the import, run the exact recovery grant printed by PAM and
retry the same command:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- model import \
  qwen/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-q4-k-s \
  --path /absolute/path/to/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-Q4_K_S.gguf \
  --digest sha256:56a7d00783419bcb0ae566253c371bcb3678261bb79881a553539f5679864db4 \
  --size-bytes 17456012448 \
  --license-id Apache-2.0 \
  --license-url https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct/blob/b2cff646eb4bb1d68355c01b18ae02e7cf42d120/LICENSE \
  --license-notice-digest sha256:832dd9e00a68dd83b3c3fb9f5588dad7dcf337a0db50f7d9483f310cd292e92e \
  --accept-license
```

Start the daemon with that profile and invoke it over PAM's authenticated local
protocol. The first generation is default-denied until its printed exact-effect
grant is added; retry the identical request after granting it.

Terminal 1:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- daemon \
  --model qwen/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-q4-k-s
```

Terminal 2:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- model generate \
  qwen/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-q4-k-s \
  'Explain this Rust compiler error and propose the smallest safe fix.' \
  --tokens 256
```

The daemon runs in the foreground and shuts down cleanly on Ctrl-C. If an
interrupted daemon leaves stale local endpoint state, recover it explicitly
with `cargo run -p pam_cli -- daemon --recover`. The native GUI boundary is
available as `cargo run -p pam_cli -- gui`. `pam brief` requires `ptrack` to be
installed and initialized for that exact project root; otherwise it reports the
source as unavailable. Durable request observers use `pam wait <request-id>` and
`pam result <request-id>`. A brief's exact source can be inspected with
`pam evidence show <evidence-handle>` or written byte-for-byte with
`--raw`/`--output`.

If policy returns an approval challenge, decide it and retry that same
operation with the explicit one-time receipt:

```sh
cargo run -p pam_cli -- approval approve <approval-id>
cargo run -p pam_cli -- status --approval-id <approval-id>
```

`--approval-id <ID>` is available on the single-request `status`, `brief`,
`wait`, `result`, and `network diagnostics` commands. The receipt is attached
only to the command that explicitly supplies it; PAM does not read approval
authority from the environment.

`evidence show` deliberately does not accept an approval receipt. One evidence
download spans an inspection request followed by one or more bounded range-read
requests, while a one-time receipt authorizes exactly one protocol request and
cannot be reused across that sequence. A protocol client may retry the exact
challenged evidence request with its receipt.

## Security model

Local endpoint reachability is not authorization: callers authenticate, policy
is evaluated for the exact project/capability/resource, and required approvals
are consumed transactionally immediately before dispatch. PAM nevertheless
relies on the operating-system account and per-user data-directory protections
for local administrative CLI operations and direct database access; an
untrusted process with unrestricted execution as that same user is inside the
current administrative trust boundary.

See the [local daemon threat model](docs/security/local-daemon-threat-model.md)
for assets, actors, trust boundaries, current mitigations, planned hardening,
residual risks, severity calibration, and a test-linked validation matrix.

Local quality gates match the portable Linux checks:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
```

## Desktop previews

The Tauri 2 shell packages the same typed Rust desktop core and React interface
for five native targets:

| Platform | Architecture | Preview package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | amd64, arm64 | AppImage and DEB |
| Windows | amd64, arm64 | NSIS installer |
| macOS 12+ | arm64 only | application bundle and DMG |

Every package includes the matching `pam` helper. GitHub Actions builds each
target on a native runner after the Linux Rust and frontend gates pass. The
macOS job imports the repository's configured certificate and App Store Connect
key into an ephemeral runner keychain, signs with the hardened runtime,
notarizes and staples the app and DMG, validates Gatekeeper, then destroys the
temporary signing material. Successful runs retain short-lived CI artifacts
for seven days; because this repository is public, those artifacts are public
to repository readers. They are previews, not a tagged GitHub Release, and no
package registry is published.

Plan 13 UI acceptance is intentionally separate from this distribution matrix:
it records current native-renderer evidence on the available macOS host and
Parallels Ubuntu guest, without claiming Windows or duplicate CPU architectures
as independently exercised UI surfaces.

Project continuity still requires a local `ptrack` installation. Desktop
launches resolve it from an explicit absolute `PAM_PTRACK_EXECUTABLE`, beside
the application, common per-user install directories such as `~/.local/bin`,
and finally `PATH`, so Finder and desktop-menu launches do not depend on an
interactive shell profile.

For an unsigned local Apple Silicon build:

```sh
npm --prefix frontend ci
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 \
  npm --prefix frontend run tauri -- build \
  --target aarch64-apple-darwin --bundles app
tools/package-macos-dmg.sh \
  "$PWD/target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/bundle/macos/PAM.app" \
  "$PWD/target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/bundle/dmg"
```

The React interface uses native HTML controls, DOM focus order, labeled regions,
keyboard shortcuts, reduced-motion behavior, and forced-color fallbacks. The
preview does not claim complete VoiceOver or WCAG conformance until the full
platform interaction matrix is independently verified.

The prototype translates the approved "Project Current" direction into a
responsive, interactive screen with project switching, daemon control, agent
handoff, evidence inspection, and flow/access states:

```sh
cd prototype
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the [prototype visual QA](prototype/design-qa.md) for the original source
target. The approved PAM Current screen remains the content contract; the
production React interface renders it inside p-track's compact shell grammar.
