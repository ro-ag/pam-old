# PAM desktop layout contract

Status: normative for Plan 14, tasks 85–89. PAM ships two independent theme
families, each with light and dark variants. Ventisquero provides Mist light
and Bedrock dark, with Ice actions and restrained copper events. Viña del Mar
provides Dawn light and Night dark, with violet actions and restrained coral
events. Inter carries interface text; Ventisquero uses Archivo for display and
IBM Plex Mono for data, while Viña uses Space Grotesk for display and JetBrains
Mono for data. The Current/Flows/Access hierarchy is identical in all four
appearances. A visible surface must never combine tokens from both families.

## Authorities

- PAM visual and content authority: `frontend/src/selectors.ts`, typed fixture
  responses, and `qa/ui-modernization/reference-board-1280x800.png`.
- Theme authority: `frontend/src/styles.css` owns both families' semantic token
  maps, `frontend/src/theme.ts` owns family and variant selection, and
  `frontend/public/assets/ventisquero-yelcho.png` plus
  `frontend/public/assets/vina-sunset.png` are the canonical source imagery.
- Shell authority: the measured geometry in this document, implemented by
  `frontend/src/styles.css` and locked by `frontend/e2e/pam.spec.ts`.
- Visual checks for the shipped spatial grammar:
  `qa/ui-modernization/zcode-reference-vs-pam-canvas-2360x800.png` and
  `qa/ui-modernization/canvas-composition-before-after-2360x800.png`.

PAM owns identity, visible product concepts, narrative hierarchy, and the
modern shell geometry below. Typed PAM responses own every displayed fact.

## Shell geometry and density

The desktop root fills the native viewport and uses three columns:
`sidebar | 5px separator | minmax(0, 1fr) workspace`. The sidebar defaults to
248px and clamps to `180px..min(420px, 45vw)`. Hiding it collapses both the
sidebar and separator columns to zero; the toolbar toggle remains available.

The workspace contains one inset canvas. At comfortable desktop density it has
a 10px inset on the top, right, and bottom, with its left edge beginning
immediately after the separator; compact density — the default — substitutes a
6px inset without changing the shell structure. The canvas has a 1px theme boundary, an 18px
radius, clipped outer overflow, a soft elevated shadow, and a fixed first row
for the toolbar; only the canvas body scrolls. The root and sidebar share the
theme chrome; the workspace is the only large floating surface.
Desktop body scrolling and horizontal shell scrolling are failures. Recovery
and empty-state content is bounded to 660px.

Comfortable spacing tokens are `4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32px`.
Compact density is a real alternate scale, not another name for comfortable:
`3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 14 / 17 / 22px`. Components must consume tokens so the
whole surface tightens together. The measured 10px desktop canvas inset is a
comfortable-density value; compact density substitutes 6px without changing
the shell structure. The 4px mobile inset is fixed across densities.

Density is a single `--density` factor: 1 at comfortable, 0.8 at compact.
Compact is the default; the toggle lives in the toolbar theme menu and
persists like theme and variant. Component vertical metrics — row min-heights,
paddings, gaps, and dense-row leading — consume the tokens or the factor per
the requirement above; font sizes, borders, radii, breakpoints, column widths,
and the fixed shell geometry (248/5/52/34/68) never scale, and interactive
targets clamp at a 28px floor.

## Sidebar, toolbar, and canvas anatomy

The sidebar order is PAM identity, active-project switcher, Current/Flows/Access
navigation, then bottom utilities and daemon control. Active state, labels,
counts, and full project names must not depend on hover. Long names truncate in
the shell but expose their full accessible name. PAM's compact state is a 68px
icon rail; opening full navigation at compact widths places it above a scrim,
makes the workspace inert and `aria-hidden`, moves focus into navigation, and
returns focus to the toolbar toggle on close.

The 5px separator is a focusable vertical `role="separator"` with current,
minimum, and responsive maximum ARIA values. Primary-pointer drag uses pointer
capture, updates the clamped width continuously, and commits once on
`pointerup`, `pointercancel`, or lost capture. Keyboard behavior is exact:
Left/Right changes 16px, Page Down/Page Up changes -64/+64px, Home selects
180px, and End selects the responsive maximum. Resize is unavailable while the
sidebar is hidden or while a modal onboarding state owns the shell.

Width and desktop collapsed state persist under named, PAM-specific
frontend storage keys. PAM has no typed native layout DTO, so this preference
must not invent a parallel backend command; a future typed native record may
supersede the frontend store. Invalid or stale widths are clamped on read,
storage failure never breaks the live layout, and transient responsive
drawer/rail openness is not persisted.

The toolbar is the canvas's 52px top row. Its icon controls are 34px high and
use rounded, visible hover, focus, and tooltip states. The left group holds the
sidebar toggle and project context; the right group holds the Radix theme and
variant selector, bounded queue, refresh, and project actions. Theme family and
variant persist independently, restore before the first React render, and apply
at the document root so portalled menus and dialogs share the selected tokens. Empty toolbar
space may be a native drag region, while all interactive controls are explicitly
non-draggable. On macOS the Tauri window uses an overlay titlebar and hidden
native title, with explicit drag regions and a traffic-light-safe sidebar
inset. Beneath it, the Current view begins with a flat compact project hero and
one three-part summary strip, followed by a two-column activity and handoff
area. Inner surfaces use radii no larger than 12px and no large elevation.
The activity timeline, collapsible outcome, provenance, and handoff actions
retain their truthful sequence. The two columns collapse below 1100px. At low
height, the canvas scrolls so Copy outcome brief, Open evidence, and Continue
flow all remain reachable.

## Drawers, dialogs, and overlays

Evidence, queue, and approval details use a right drawer no wider than
`min(520px, calc(100vw - 28px))`, inset from the viewport with a 24px radius,
with a fixed header and independently scrollable body. Centered dialogs use
`min(440px, 100%)` and a viewport-bounded
height. At narrow widths, dialogs align to the top and action rows stack.

Only the most recently opened application overlay is active. Earlier visible
overlays and the workspace become inert and `aria-hidden`; layering must be
deterministic. Dialogs and drawers trap Tab/Shift+Tab, Escape closes only the
active overlay, backdrop dismissal is available where the action is safe, and
focus returns to the exact opener. Loading, empty, failure, binary, truncated,
and retry states render inside the same bounded surface without changing its
geometry. Toasts are status announcements, never the only evidence of success
or failure.

## Responsive and accessibility rules

At 1360px and above, wide viewports use a list+detail grammar instead of
stacking: Skills and Connections place their paired panels in a two-column
`wide-split` grid, and the Access and Activity lists flow their rows two-up.
This widens content only; the shell geometry and all narrower breakpoints are
unchanged.

p-track has exactly three shell breakpoints; PAM inherits their intent:

- At 1180px and below, compact broad content and low-value toolbar/status
  labels before constraining primary content.
- At 960px and below, compound grids become one column, action groups wrap,
  and controls use `min-width: 0`; no card may force horizontal overflow.
- At 600px and below, reflow the shell to one column, remove the separator,
  place the compact navigation row above the workspace, allow document-height
  scrolling, use a fixed 4px canvas inset, and top-align dialogs and recovery
  cards. At 420px and below, the toolbar stays on one 52px row and hides its
  redundant breadcrumb so all icon controls remain reachable.

780px is a required PAM native acceptance width, not a p-track breakpoint and
must not be described as one. Its icon-rail/overlay navigation is PAM-specific.
Effective 320 CSS-pixel acceptance comes from the 600px reflow rules under 400%
zoom, not from a new 320px breakpoint. It must have no horizontal document
scroll, long identifiers must wrap or elide accessibly, and every handoff action
must remain reachable. Access library forms, exact-target selectors, preview
actions, and their apply buttons follow the same rule: they stack to the
available width and never require horizontal scrolling to reach an action.

Every interactive element has a visible `:focus-visible` treatment using the
selected theme's focus token; clipped controls use a 2px inward outline. Focus order follows visual
order, current navigation uses `aria-current`, toggle state is named, and status
changes use appropriate polite status or assertive alert regions. Reduced-motion
`always` and the system `prefers-reduced-motion` path reduce transitions and
animations to 0.01ms and disable smooth scrolling; an explicit `never` setting
may opt out of the media query. In forced colors, focus uses `Highlight`,
disabled controls use `GrayText`, structural boundaries use system colors, and
meaning is never communicated by color alone.

## Truth and content constraints

The approved image is a composition reference, not permission to invent live
facts. Production UI obeys these rules:

- Timeline ordering is labelled `Sequence 1` through `Sequence N`. Do not
  synthesize wall-clock times, relative ages, or a current timestamp.
- Daemon identity may show only the returned daemon version and an accurate
  lifecycle phrase. Never display a mock Qwen name, model memory, token/latency
  telemetry, or model availability that the protocol did not report.
- Project branch, request status, outcome sections, evidence handles, queue
  counts, approvals, and access facts come only from the typed active-project
  response. Do not infer grants from configuration or turn unavailable data
  into optimistic copy.
- Access distinguishes observed, policy-gated, disabled, and unavailable facts.
  Approval copy states the exact bounded effect, project, capability/policy,
  expiry, and opaque handle supplied by the protocol.
- Access keeps four skill facts separate. **Observed** means the bounded project
  inventory detected an artifact; it does not enable or claim ownership.
  **Enabled** is the returned exact entry/version/agent selection for the active
  project. **Managed** means PAM recorded ownership only after verified
  publication. **Drift** is unknown until an explicit read-only inspection and
  then renders only the returned closed state (`clean`, `missing`, `modified`,
  or a typed conflict). The UI never derives one fact from another.
- Library additions and target mutations are explicit forms or buttons. Every
  request carries a fresh operation UUID plus the active opaque project handle
  and generation. A preview is applyable only for the same entry, version, and
  agent; selection or project changes discard it. Mutation success appears only
  after an exact fenced result and a second verified library load. Source bytes,
  local source paths, and Git URLs exist only in the explicit install form and
  outbound request, are cleared after verified success, and never return in the
  library snapshot or appear as provenance. Destination roots and internal
  project keys never cross the Desktop response boundary.
- Solved, unresolved, blocked, cancelled, loading, offline, credential-recovery,
  and stale-project states retain their truthful terminal meaning. A decorative
  or fixture success must never leak into production.

## Plan 14 acceptance gate

Task 89 requires current-run UI evidence on the locally available native
renderers in scope: the macOS arm64 host and Parallels Ubuntu 24.04.3 arm64.
Duplicate amd64/arm64 validation and Windows UI validation are not part of this
UI gate; the existing five-target package-build matrix remains separate
distribution and portability coverage.

The deterministic Vitest and Playwright suites own the complete typed state and
interaction matrix: Current lifecycle states, Access available/blocked,
library load/adopt/install/enable/disable/preview/apply/drift/resync,
evidence loading/text/binary/truncated/failure, Flows valid/invalid,
drawers/dialogs, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, forced colors, 780px,
and effective-320px reflow. Each native renderer must additionally launch the
production-mode Tauri application with the shipped frontend assets and pass a
bounded package/render smoke covering startup, shell geometry, asset and font
loading, viewport containment, and representative keyboard/overlay behavior.
Native smoke must not be described as proof that every backend state is
deterministically reachable through the production daemon on every platform.

Acceptance requires every P0 and P1 mismatch to be closed, the three core
handoff actions to remain reachable, zero horizontal document overflow, correct
focus/inert restoration, a current screenshot/measurement set, and current
native evidence from each available renderer. Fixture-only, browser-only,
stale, or fabricated results do not satisfy the gate by themselves.
